Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================
The goal of the project was to produce a tidy data set using data generated by Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set project (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The resulting tidy dataset was uploaded to Coursera and is also available in ./data/tidy_set.txt file. 

I used run_analysis.R script to perform all necessary steps to produce tidy_set.txt. run_analysis.R file contains comments which describe steps in details.

Running run_analysis.R
======================
The script is self containing and does not require any special environment setup. The script will download all necessary data and create all required directoris. To execute the script simply run in R Studio or R.
